## LinkedIn Integration

### Overview
Mr. Grammar includes specialized support for LinkedIn messaging that addresses the unique challenges of LinkedIn's rich text editor. The extension uses multiple fallback methods to ensure corrected text is properly registered by LinkedIn's internal state before messages are sent.

### How It Works
1. **Multi-Method Approach**: The extension tries four different methods to replace text:
   - Direct DOM manipulation with comprehensive event triggering
   - Programmatic text insertion with focus management
   - Clipboard-based replacement
   - Simulated user typing

2. **State Synchronization**: After text replacement, the extension triggers multiple events to ensure LinkedIn's internal state is updated:
   - `input` events
   - `change` events
   - `compositionstart` and `compositionend` events
   - `keyup` events
   - Focus/blur cycles

3. **Comprehensive Selector Support**: The extension searches for LinkedIn message composers using multiple selectors to handle different LinkedIn interfaces and updates.

### Troubleshooting LinkedIn Issues

If you're experiencing issues with LinkedIn messaging:

1. **Open Browser Console**: Press F12 and go to the Console tab
2. **Run Debug Command**: Type `debugLinkedInGrammarFixer()` and press Enter
3. **Check Output**: Look for information about found message composers and their properties
4. **Verify Selection**: Ensure text is properly selected before using the extension

### Common LinkedIn Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Corrected text appears visually but original text is sent
- **Solution**: The extension now uses multiple fallback methods and comprehensive event triggering to ensure LinkedIn's state is properly updated

**Issue**: Extension doesn't work in LinkedIn messaging
- **Solution**: Make sure you're on `www.linkedin.com` and try refreshing the page if the extension was installed after the page loaded

**Issue**: Text replacement doesn't work in specific LinkedIn contexts
- **Solution**: The extension supports multiple LinkedIn interfaces including direct messages, connection requests, and post comments
